# Accelerating Graph Traversals: Parallel BFS and DFS Optimization on CUDA-enabled GPUs

This repository contains the final project for the *Parallel Systems* course, titled **Accelerating Graph Traversals: Parallel BFS and DFS Optimization on CUDA-enabled GPUs**. The project explores and implements optimized versions of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms using CUDA to accelerate graph traversal on GPU hardware.

## üìà Project Goals
Analyze and compare sequential vs. parallel traversal methods.

Utilize different memory and load-balancing optimizations (e.g., bitmap frontiers, warp-centric design).

Study performance gains and bottlenecks in large-scale graph traversal.

## Repository Structure

  - `bfs-level-sync-bitmap-cuda.cu` ‚Äì Bitmap-based level-synchronous CUDA BFS
  - `bfs-warp-centric.cu` ‚Äì Warp-centric bitmap CUDA BFS
  - `Makefile` ‚Äì Build rules for BFS implementations
  - `example_graphs/`
    - `roadNet-CA.mtx` ‚Äì Sample graph (real-world road network)

- `depth-first-search/`
  - `dfs.c` ‚Äì Sequential DFS implementation
  - `dfs-cuda.cu` ‚Äì Topological order-based parallel CUDA DFS

 - Python 3 (for DAG generation)


## üìå BFS Implementations


### Compilation:
Run the following inside the `breadth-first-search/` directory:
```bash
make 
```
### Example Usage
After compilation, to run the warp-centric BFS implementation:
```
./bfs-warp-centric ./example_graphs/roadNet-CA.mtx
```

Other executables (e.g., bfs-level-sync-cuda, bfs-level-sync-bitmap-cuda) can also be run similarly by replacing the binary name.

## üìå DFS Implementations


### Compilation:
Run the following inside the `depth-first-search/` directory:
```bash
make 
```
### Example Usage
After compilation, to run the CUDA-accelerated DFS:

```
./dfs ./dataset/asia.mtx
```

Sample graphs for testing are provided in the dataset/ folder.
